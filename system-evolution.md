# System evolution

There are a lot of implementations on the website and they can be done in the future and the team is aware of that, the problem is that this is an evolving environment and it is changing all the time, applying a feedback mechanism will help us to know not only how to implement our ideas in the future, but if our ideas are not useless to the market.

Also, following this mechanism will help us to get new ideas for system evolution to be implemented in the near or far term knowing that feedback page was not mentioned in the proposal, it was decided later specifically for the purpose of system evolution.
