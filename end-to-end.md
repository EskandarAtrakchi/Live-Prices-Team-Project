# End-to-end

Important points to high light Joshua, Yonas, and Alex should discus the following with Eskandar:

1. **API Design:**
   * Back-end dev (Eskandar) design and implement APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that define how data and functionality are exposed to the front-end.
   * Front-end developers and back-end developers communicate about the structure of the API, the data it provides, and the expected responses.
2. **Data Format and Structure:**
   * Deciding on the format and structure of data exchanged between the frontend and backend. This includes discussions on data models, serialization formats (e.g., JSON), and data validation, we will use JSON data format in most cases but still we need to discuss if there is potential changes&#x20;
3. **Endpoints and Routes:**
   * Collaborating on defining the endpoints and routes for API calls. Front-end developers need to know how to make requests to the back-end, and back-end developer need to ensure that the server handles these requests correctly.
4. **Error Handling:**
   * I will be defining the error messages and codes that the back-end can send to the front-end in case of issues. Front-end developers need to understand how to handle errors in a good way.
5. **Testing and Debugging:**
   * Coordinating testing efforts, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, to ensure that the front-end and back-end components work well together knowing that those methodologies of testing is detailed in Software Quality and testing lecture.
6. **Versioning:**
   * Agreeing on API versioning strategies to handle changes and updates without disrupting the functionality of the front-end application, all front-end users have to communicate with me constantly to prevent potential errors.&#x20;
7. **Scalability:**
   * Discussing strategies for scalability, especially when anticipating increased traffic and load. This involves considerations on how both front-end and back-end can scale horizontally or vertically, all front-end users have to communicate with me constantly to prevent potential errors.&#x20;
